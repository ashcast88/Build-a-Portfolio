  <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority 
    have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words 
    which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of 
    Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the 
    middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat 
    predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the 
    Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful 
    of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable 
    repeat predefined chunks as necessary, m Ipsum is therefore always free from 
    repetition, injected humour, repeat predefined chunks as necessary, or 
    non-characteristic words from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic 
    words etc.

      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
